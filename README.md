## How The App Should Work
Eat-Da-Burger! is a an app for a burger joint which allows users to input the burger they would like to eat. Upon submission the burger name will display on the left side of the screen under Ordered Burgers along with a button saying Devour. If user clicks the button the burger will move to the right side of the page under devoured burgers. This app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
